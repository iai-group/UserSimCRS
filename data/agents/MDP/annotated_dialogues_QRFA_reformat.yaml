      detachment. In the last battle to capture the caravan, the white lieutenant
      Govorukha-Otrok was taken prisoner, sent on a diplomatic mission from Admiral
      Kolchak to General Denikin. The soldiers are trying to return to their own,

      where Maria, Govorukha-Otrok and several fighters take a boat to reach the mainland.
      All Red Army soldiers die during a storm, and Maria and Lieutenant are thrown
      alone on the island.

    utterance: Aging master gemcutter Prokopych is forced to take up a young apprentice
      against his will. He chooses young daredevil Danilo, who seems to have only
      one practical talent - the one for gemcutting. In time he becomes obsessed with
      his job and eventually outdoes even Prokopych. Prokopych's landlord orders the
      two to make him a stone casket so beautiful it will even impress a French marquess
      he made a bet with. Danilo gladly takes this challenge upon himself but Prokopych
      warns him that he mustn't let his craft consume him. Unfortunately, Danilo won't
      listen and after failing to make a stone casket so perfect that it seems like
      the stone had come to life, he abandons both his worried master and his lovely
      and loving fiancee Katya to travel to the legendary Copper Mountain where the
      most beautiful stone cup ever created is located. In fact, the cup is said to
      be so enchanting that no one wants to (or can) leave the mountain ever again
      after seeing it just once. Danilo plans to uncover its secret but instead falls
      pray to it magic as well. The Mistress of the Copper Mountain (aka Khozyayka
      Medhoy Gori) tales a liking to him and uses her sorcery to keep him by her side
      forever. Meanwhile, Prokopych agrees to train Katyenka as well and she agrees
      to look after him so they can help each other make their ends meet together.
      Will there be a happy ending for her and Danilo?
