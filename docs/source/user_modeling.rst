User modeling
=============

Preference model
----------------

Preference modeling refers to modeling users' individual tastes and allows for a personalized experience. We model preferences as a Personal Knowledge Graph (PGK), where nodes can be either items or attributes. The preference model is built such that it remains consistent across simulations.

Context model
-------------

In addition to preference and interaction modeling, we also model other user contexts, such as temporal and relational context.
For example, during *weekdays*, a person might be busy with work and have other obligations that can change e.g., the information that they are willing to provide. On the other hand, during *weekends*, people are usually more relaxed and in a better mood in general, which could lead to the opposite effect.

Persona
-------

Persona contains user variables, e.g., age, education level, etc. These characteristics also affect the language of a person. People with higher education might have more formal language and vice versa. Age will also affect word choices and sentence structure.
