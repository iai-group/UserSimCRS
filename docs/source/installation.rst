Installation
============

The recommended version of Python is 3.9.  
The easiest way to install UserSimCRS and all of its dependencies is by using pip:

.. code-block:: shell
    
    python -m pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt


To work on the documentation you also need to install other dependencies:

.. code-block:: shell

    python -m pip install -r requirements/docs_requirements.txt
