# User modeling

## Preference model

Preference modeling refers to modeling usersâ€™ individual tastes and allows for a personalized experience. We model preferences as a Personal Knowledge Graph (PGK), where nodes can be either items or attributes. The preference model is built such that it remains consistent across simulations.

## Context model

In addition to preference and interaction modeling, we also model other user contexts, specifically temporal and relational. Temporal context refers to time context such as *time of the day* and whether it is a *weekday* or *weekend*. Relational context on the other hand is used to indicate the group setting of the user.

## Persona

Persona contains user variables, e.g., cooperativeness.
