UserSimCRS is an extensible user simulation toolkit for evaluating conversational recommender systems.  

It is built on top of the [DialogueKit](https://github.com/iai-group/dialoguekit) library, which provides basic dialogue management functionalities.

UserSimCRS follows the architecture of a typical task-based dialogue system, which consists of natural language understanding, response generation, and natural language generation components. Additionally, there is a dedicated user modeling component in order to make simulation more human-like.

  * **Natural language understanding** is responsible for obtaining a structured representation of text utterances.  Conventionally, it entails intent classification and entity recognition.  Additionally, we also include a classifier for user satisfaction prediction.
  * **Response generation** is currently based on agenda-based simulation, however, there are plans for extending the library with other approaches in the future.  Agenda-based response generation is based on an *interaction model*, which specifies the space of user and agent actions.
  * **User modeling** consists of three sub-components: *preference model* (to capture individual tastes, e.g., likes and dislikes), *context model* (to characterize the situation of the user, e.g., time of the day), and *persona* (to capture user-specific traits, e.g., user cooperativeness).  
  * **Natural language generation** is currently template-based, but it can be conditioned on context (e.g., users could use a different language depending on the time of day or based on their satisfaction with the system).

We refer to the [documentation](https://iai-group.github.io/UserSimCRS/) for details. Specifically, see [this page](https://iai-group.github.io/UserSimCRS/setup_agent.html) on how to set up an existing agent to be evaluated using UserSimCRS.

## Installation

The recommended version of Python is 3.9.  
The easiest way to install UserSimCRS and all of its dependencies is by using pip:

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

To work on the documentation you also need to install other dependencies:

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements/docs_requirements.txt
```

## Usage 

A YAML configuration file is necessary to start the MovieBot; see [default configuration](config/default/config_default.yaml) for an example.  
Run the following command to start the simulation:

```shell
python -m usersimcrs.run_simulation -c <path_to_config.yaml>
```

### Example

This example shows how to run simulation using the default configuration and the [IAI MovieBot](https://github.com/iai-group/MovieBot) as the conversational agent.

1. Start IAI MovieBot locally

  * Download the IAI MovieBot [here](https://github.com/iai-group/MovieBot/)
  * Checkout to the 'separate-flask-server' branch
  * Follow the IAI MovieBot installation instructions
  * Start the IAI MovieBot locally: `python -m run_bot -c config/moviebot_config_no_integration.yaml`

Note: you need to update the parameter `agent_uri` in the configuration in case MovieBot does not run on the default URI (i.e., `http://127.0.0.1:5001`).

2. Run simulation

```shell
python -m usersimcrs.run_simulation -c config/default/config_default.yaml
```

After the simulation, the YAML configuration is saved under `data/runs` using the `output_name` parameter.
The simulated dialogue is saved under `dialogue_export`.
