UserSimCRS is an extensible user simulation toolkit for evaluating conversational recommender systems.  

It is built on top of the [DialogueKit](https://github.com/iai-group/dialoguekit) library, which provides basic dialogue management functionalities.

UserSimCRS follows the architecture of a typical task-based dialogue system, which consists of natural language understanding, response generation, and natural language generation components. Additionally, there is a dedicated user modeling component in order to make simulation more human-like.

  * **Natural language understanding** is responsible for obtaining a structured representation of text utterances.  Conventionally, it entails intent classification and entity recognition.  Additionally, we also include a classifier for user satisfaction prediction.
  * **Response generation** is currently based on agenda-based simulation, however, there are plans for extending the library with other approaches in the future.  Agenda-based response generation is based on an *interaction model*, which specifies the space of user and agent actions.
  * **User modeling** consists of three sub-components: *preference model* (to capture individual tastes, e.g., likes and dislikes), *context model* (to characterize the situation of the user, e.g., time of the day), and *persona* (to capture user-specific traits, e.g., user cooperativeness).  
  * **Natural language generation** is currently template-based, but it can be conditioned on context (e.g., users could use a different language depending on the time of day or based on their satisfaction with the system).

We refer to the [documentation](https://iai-group.github.io/UserSimCRS/) for details. Specifically, see [this page](https://iai-group.github.io/UserSimCRS/setup_agent.html) on how to set up an existing agent to be evaluated using UserSimCRS.
