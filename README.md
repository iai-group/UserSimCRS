# UserSimCRS

Conversational Recommender System Evaluation via Simulation

To add a new recommender, we require the following

* A file defining the intent/action space.
* A sample of dialogs between humans and the agent, where utterances are annotated with intent and action.
* Consult the [documentation](https://iai-group.github.io/UserSimCRS/) for details.

Other requirements:

* DialogueKit installed, see [how](https://github.com/iai-group/dialoguekit).
