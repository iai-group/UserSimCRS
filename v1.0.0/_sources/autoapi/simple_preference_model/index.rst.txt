simple_preference_model
=======================

.. py:module:: simple_preference_model

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Simple user preference modeling component.

   This class implements the "single item preference" approach in [Zhang & Balog,
   KDD'20].

   - Whenever a user is prompted whether they had seen/consumed a specific item, we
     answer that based on historical data.
   - Whenever the user is prompted for their preference on a given item or
     slot-value pair, we provide a positive/negative response by flipping a coin
     (i.e., either -1 or +1 as the preference).
   - Whenever the user is prompted for a preference on a given slot, a random value
     among the existing slot values is picked and returned as positive preference.

   The responses given are remembered so that the user would respond the same way
   if they are asked the same question again.

   This approach offers limited consistency. Items that are seen/consumed are
   rooted in real user behavior, but the preferences expressed about them are not.
   Hence, the user might express a preference about a slot that is inconsistent
   with the answers given to other questions (e.g., likes "action" as a genre, but
   has not seen a single action movie).

.. py:class:: SimplePreferenceModel(domain: dialoguekit.core.domain.Domain, item_collection: usersimcrs.items.item_collection.ItemCollection, historical_ratings: usersimcrs.items.ratings.Ratings, historical_user_id: str = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`usersimcrs.user_modeling.preference_model.PreferenceModel`


   Initializes the simple preference model of a simulated user.

   :param domain: Domain.
   :param item_collection: Item collection.
   :param historical_ratings: Historical ratings.
   :param historical_user_id: If provided, the simulated user is
                              based on this particular historical user; otherwise, it is based
                              on a randomly sampled user. This is mostly added to make the
                              class testable. Defaults to None.
   :type historical_user_id: Optional


   .. py:method:: get_item_preference(item_id: str) -> float

      Returns a preference for a given item.

      :param item_id: Item ID.

      :returns: Randomly chosen preference, which is either -1 or +1.

      :raises ValueError: If the item does not exist in the collection.



   .. py:method:: get_slot_value_preference(slot: str, value: str) -> float

      Returns a preference on a given slot-value pair.

      :param slot: Slot name (needs to exist in the domain).
      :param value: Slot value.

      :returns: Randomly chosen preference, which is either -1 or +1.
